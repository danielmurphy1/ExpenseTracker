### Summary

I created this app to specifically to learn how to dynamically populate a web-based table, as opposed to the To Do list App, which populates items to an unordered list. (You can access my To Do app [here](https://danielmurphy1.github.io/ToDoApp/)).

In creating this app, I continued to build on my skills in DOM manipulation. I learned how to create multiple interations of the same element dynamically in the DOM using a for loop and appending different values to each using an array during each iteration.
