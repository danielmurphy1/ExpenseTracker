### Summary

I created this app to specifically to learn how to dynamically populate a web-based table, as opposed to the To Do list App, which populates items to an unordered list. (You can access my To Do app [here](https://danielmurphy1.github.io/ToDoApp/)).

In creating this app, I continued to build on my skills in DOM manipulation. I learned how to create multiple iterations of the same element dynamically in the DOM using a for loop and appending different values to each using an array during each iteration. 

Update: I upddated the script file for this application to take advantage of the learning that I have done since I first created this application. I grouped together related variables into an object literal. Moreover, I refoctored the code into functions which makes the code easier to read and debug, which will also make expansion of the code easier should I choose to scale this application in the future.
